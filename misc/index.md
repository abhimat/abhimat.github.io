## Blogs

### [Radial Infall](http://radialinfall.com)
Radial Infall is my personal, rarely updated, weblog.


### [Astronyms](http://astronyms.net/)
Astronomers often come up with some of the most clever (or convoluted, if you will) acronyms. Astronyms is an infrequently updated collection gathering my favorites all in one place. You can even [submit](http://astronyms.net/submit) your own!

### Colophon

I lovingly handcrafted the frontend of this website myself (bugs and all üêû‚ù§Ô∏è). The HTML and CSS I wrote to build this website is available at this [git repository](https://github.com/abhimat/abhimat.github.io). The backend I'm using for this website is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and the website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

This website is typeset in [Futura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)) and [Source Sans Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans_Pro), and uses absolutely the best organic, free-range electrons available for delivery across the world wide web.
