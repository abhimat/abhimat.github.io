# Abhimat Gautam's Website

Hi, you've found the git repository for my [personal website](https://abhimat.net/).

I've set this up as a [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com). This git repository provides a basic framework to set up a similar simple personal website if you are also interested! If you do base your own website off of this repository, I'd appreciate at least a simple link back to this repository. Thanks!
