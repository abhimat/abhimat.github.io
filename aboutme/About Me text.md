## **Abhimat Krishna Gautam**

I'm an astronomy graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I love stars and galaxies. My other interests include running, drawing, typography, photography, stargazing, writing, and a huge obsession with [a certain fruit company](https://www.apple.com) in California.

To learn what I am up to right now, you can read my [personal blog](http://abhimat.tumblr.com/) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abhimatgautam).
