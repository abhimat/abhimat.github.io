## UCLA Planetarium

I regularly give planetarium shows to public and local school audiences at the UCLA Planetarium. Shows consist of a special topic portion (with topics ranging to solar system astronomy to stellar and galactic astronomy, depending on audience age), and a star show. I've also developed special topic shows titled "How to take pictures of a black hole!" and "Neutron Stars and Pulsars", both suitable for a general public audience.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I created and hosted a [virtual planetarium show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaNcHjhigVA) aimed for the general public, about the Milky Way, the center of the galaxy, and radio interferometry images of black hole shadows!

As a graduate student at UCLA, I served as a graduate student coordinator helping run the [UCLA Planetarium](http://astro.ucla.edu/planetarium/) for 5 years. With approximately 4000 guests annually, the planetarium is the largest astronomy outreach at UCLA. As coordinator, I helped organize visits to the planetarium for local schools and recruit graduate student volunteers for our shows.

## Science Writing

I like to share my enthusiasm for science and astronomy through writing. My current outlet for this is my personal blog [Radial Infall](http://radialinfall.com).

In the past, my science writing mostly went on my (now retired) blog [Astronomy and Space](http://astronomyandspace.net). I have also regularly contributed to the Lunar and Planetary Institute's (now also retired) website [MyMoon](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/features/myMoon/index.shtml).

## UCLA Astronomy Live!<br>and Exploring Your Universe

I have volunteered for UCLA's Astronomy Live!, visiting local K--12 schools to perform various astronomy demonstrations.

I've served on the organizing committee for 4 years on UCLA's annual science event, Exploring Your Universe. In addition to helping coordinate the general logistics of the event, I developed the overall design of the event (detailed in much more detail over [here](/art/graphic-design/EYU/)!).
