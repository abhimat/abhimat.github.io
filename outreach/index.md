## UCLA Planetarium

I regularly give planetarium shows to public and local school audiences at the UCLA Planetarium. Shows consist of a special topic portion (with topics ranging to solar system astronomy to stellar and galactic astronomy, depending on audience age), and a star show. I've also developed a special topic show about neutron stars and pulsars, suitable for a general public audience.

I'm also one of the graduate student coordinators helping run the [UCLA Planetarium](http://astro.ucla.edu/planetarium/). With approximately 4000 guests annually, our planetarium is the largest astronomy outreach at UCLA. As coordinator, I help organize visits to the planetarium for local schools and recruit graduate student volunteers for our shows.

## Science Writing

I like to share my enthusiasm for science and astronomy through writing. My current outlet for this is my personal blog [Radial Infall](http://radialinfall.com).

In the past, my science writing was contributed for my (now retired) blog [Astronomy and Space](http://astronomyandspace.net). I have also regularly contributed to the Lunar and Planetary Institute's (now also retired) website [MyMoon](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/features/myMoon/index.shtml).

## UCLA Astronomy Live!<br>and Exploring Your Universe

I regularly volunteer for UCLA's Astronomy Live!, visiting local K--12 schools to perform various astronomy demonstrations.

I've served on the organizing committee for 4 years on UCLA's annual science event, Exploring Your Universe. In addition to helping coordinate the general logistics of the event, I developed the overall design of the event (detailed in full, gory detail over [here](/art/design/EYU/)!).
