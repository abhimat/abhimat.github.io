Hi! I'm a data scientist and software engineer with a PhD in astrophysics. I like to use software, data, and statistics to help solve fun, interesting problems. The [blog here](./blog/) is a small collection of my side projects, while the [software page](./software/) collects some of my most substantial public software contributions.

I'm currently a postdoc researcher in astrophysics at UCLA. My [scientific research](./research/) primarily focuses on the stellar population and dynamical environment of the Milky Way Galactic center.

I like to dabble in [art](./art/) on the side. And you can learn even more [about me here](./aboutme/)!
