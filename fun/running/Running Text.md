I like to run. I’m not very fast and don’t do long distances, but it’s a pretty great excuse to go outside and explore!

It turns out that California has pretty awesome running weather most of the year. And conveniently enough, I’ve been stuck in California for the past few years (and will be for the several coming years… woohoo grad school!). I mostly picked up my running habit in Berkeley, and loved the Fire Trails there in the Berkeley Hills and their awe-inspiring [views](http://instagram.com/p/fbgehTjDh9/) of the San Francisco Bay. Now, I’m exploring the city of Los Angeles, and I get to [witness](http://instagram.com/p/tdPDdVDDnZ/) the grand sweeping [vistas](https://instagram.com/p/8Zi69kDDhH/) of the majestic six-lane roads.
